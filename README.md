# Build a LUIS app programmatically using Node.js

LUIS provides a programmatic API that does everything that the UI at [luis.ai](http://www.luis.ai) does. This can save time when you might have a lot of preexisting data and it'd be faster to programmatically create a LUIS app than entering information by hand.
